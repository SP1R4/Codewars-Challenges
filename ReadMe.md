## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is divided into three main folders based on the programming language used:

- **Python Challenges**: Solutions written in Python.
- **C Challenges**: Solutions written in C.

Each language folder is further organized by difficulty level, and each challenge has its own directory containing the solution and any related files.
